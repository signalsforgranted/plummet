#      oOoOoOoOo   This YAML file forms part of the implementation config,
#    0oOoOoOo0/|   which tells plummet which implementations exist, should be
#    | .---. | |   run, and if they have client and/or server capability. The
#    |{  0  }| |   names here should match the repository name under the
#    |{ \ . }| |   implementations/ directory, and all the flags consistent.

#    |{     }| |   Just a tip: when integrating a new implementation, disable
#    |{  6  }| |   all but your new implementation and one other that has both
#    | `---' | o   client and server support, so that way you avoid having to
#    |_______|/    run against every permutation and it taking a lot of time,
#    \ ____//      which we clearly don't have enough of, poetically.
